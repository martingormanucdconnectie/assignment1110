Assumption
The main assumption I made here was to use margin (incremental) costing.  Therefore I assumed that 
we are incurring the cost of the transport from locations to port all ready and the only incremental 
cost is the new processing plant to port.  


Commercial
This would not be the best commercial decision making information due to a lack of knowledge of the 
road network between locations and ports or nature of the product raw material (in bulk)
or finished goods (pallatised product).  Based upon prior knowledge a rough cost of â‚¬1 per
mile per full load could be assumed to calculate the costs of the transportation. 1 mile 
equates to 1 degree and a conversion as such is included in the cost of the transport


Programming 
# plan is to connect database to python
# convert to numpy array as upon import the values are tuples
# loop through array to calculate difference between each port and various locations
# then find the port and location (index) for the smallest difference 
# using the cost mentioned above calculate the cost of transport to port from this location only
