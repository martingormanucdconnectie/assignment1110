Commercial
This would not be the best commercial decision making informaiton due to a lack of knowledge of the 
road network between locations and ports or nature of the product raw material (in bulk)
or finished goods (pallatied product).  Based upon prior knowledge a rough cost of â‚¬1 per
mile per full load could be assumed to calculate the costs of the transporatation. 1 mile 
equates to 1 degree and a conversion as such is included in the cost of the transport


Programming 
# plan is to connect database to python
# convert to numpy array as upon import the values are tuples
# loop through array to calculate difference between each port and various locations
# then find the port and location (index) for the the smallest difference 
# using the cost mentioned above calculate the cost of tansport to port from this location only
